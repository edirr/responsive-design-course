# Assignment: Responsive Navigation Bar (with Bonus)

**Objective:** Create a simple responsive navigation bar for a website. Implement a navigation menu that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens (mobile devices). As a bonus, you can also implement the expansion of the hamburger menu when clicked.

## Project Description
You are tasked with designing a basic website for a restaurant, a product, or a service. This website should include a navigation bar with several navigation items. When viewed on larger screens, the navigation items should be visible, but on smaller screens (e.g., mobile devices), they should collapse into a hamburger menu. Expanding the hamburger menu when clicked will be a bonus part.

## Requirements

1. **HTML File (index.html):**
   - Create an HTML file (index.html) that includes the following components:
     - A header section.
     - A navigation bar with at least four navigation items (e.g., Home, Menu, About Us, Contact).
     - A main content section with some descriptive text related to your chosen restaurant, product, or service.

2. **CSS File (styles.css):**
   - Create a CSS file (styles.css) to style your website:
     - Style the header to have a background color and text color that matches the theme of your website.
     - Style the navigation bar to be horizontally aligned with the navigation items.
     - Ensure that the navigation items are evenly spaced.

3. **Implement Responsive Design:**
   - Use media queries to make the navigation bar responsive.
   - When the screen width is reduced to a mobile screen size (you can define the specific width in pixels), the navigation items should collapse into a hamburger menu.
   - The hamburger menu should have an icon (e.g., three horizontal lines) to indicate its purpose.

4. **Bonus (Optional): Implement Hamburger Menu Expansion:**
   - As a bonus, you can implement the expansion of the hamburger menu when clicked. This can be achieved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - When the hamburger menu is clicked, it should expand to show the navigation items.

## Hints

- You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve the responsive navigation bar and the bonus expansion feature.
- You may consider using external libraries or frameworks like Bootstrap if you're familiar with them.
- Test your website on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure it behaves responsively.

## Submission
Submit a zip file containing your HTML, CSS, and any additional assets (images, if used). Also, provide a brief explanation of how you achieved the responsive navigation bar and the bonus expansion feature (if implemented) in a README.md file.
