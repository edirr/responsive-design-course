## Session 1: Introduction to Responsive Web Design

**Overview of Responsive Design:** In this session, we'll delve into the concept of responsive web design, which is all about creating websites that adapt gracefully to different devices and screen sizes. Think of it as a website's ability to "shape-shift" to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience for users, whether they're on a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer.

**Basic Responsive Layout:** Hands-on practice is crucial in web development. In this part of the session, you'll actually apply media queries to create a basic responsive webpage. You'll learn how to structure your HTML and CSS to ensure that your website content rearranges and scales smoothly as the screen size changes.

## Session 2: Fluid Images and Typography

**Importance of Fluid Images:** When you hear "fluid images," think of images that can change and adapt just like water. We'll explore why these images are vital in responsive design. You'll also learn techniques to make sure your images look great on all devices and load quickly.

**Implementing Responsive Typography:** Typography is all about text, and we'll show you how to make your text look fantastic on screens of all sizes. You'll learn to use relative units like "em" and "rem" that allow fonts to adjust beautifully as screen sizes change.

**Hands-On Practice:** The best way to learn is by doing. You'll put your knowledge to work by incorporating fluid images and responsive typography into an ongoing project. This hands-on experience will help you see how these techniques enhance the overall appearance of your website.
